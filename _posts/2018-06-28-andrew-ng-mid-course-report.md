Hello Everyone! People are always wanting to get the best training in the quickest time, so that we don’t waste our precious time and money. I often hear people say things like “Are Udacity’s Courses/Nanodegrees worth it?” I don’t hear ANYBODY ask if [Andrew Ng’s Coursera.com courses](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) are worth it, but I hear a lot of people recommending them. I've heard them called them “the Gold Standard” of ML courses.

I recently made it to the Halfway point of Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course and I just wanted to share my thoughts on the course with everybody.

## Here are some great things about the Course:

1. I understand the Algorithms that we’ve covered so far! (And this is my first machine learning course, so that’s major progress!)
1. I understand how the Algorithms can be applied meaningfully! I have so many ideas for how to apply them!
1. I’ve learned Octave, a language/environment that’s really good for prototyping these type of applications. (I actually think I’m going to use it to prototype some other ML applications)
1. I’ve learned a lot about Linear Algebra in a really practical way!
1. I have a lot of confidence that what Andrew Ng says is true because he’s a thought leader in the AI/ML Industry.
1. His explanations are really clear and well-thought out. I think he has a Gift for taking complex concepts and making them simple to understand.
1. His Teaching Methods are very visual and help me to understand the intuition behind how the algorithms and math are working.

## Some Topics we’ve covered in the first half of the course:

1. Linear Algebra
1. Linear Regression (with Housing Price Prediction applications)
1. Logistic Regression (with Classifier applications)
1. Neural Networks (with a Computer Vision Application – Training a NN to predict/read digits 0-9 from images)

## Conclusion

I haven’t listed any negative points because I haven’t found any! I found that the this course has exceeded my expectations in a lot of ways. It was/is a bit harder than I thought, but I’ve found that the course goes quite deep into the algorithms and how to implement them in a deep way. We aren’t calling libraries, we are working with matrices and taking formulas and turning them into code! It’s way cool! I’ve learned SO much. I’m grateful that Andrew Ng created this course, Coursera.com, and that he has the vision that he does: that AI can change the world for the better.
