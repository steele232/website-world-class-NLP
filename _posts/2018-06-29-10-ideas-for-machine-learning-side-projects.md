Hello Everyone! Here are 10 of my many ML side project ideas! If you have questions about them, feel free to leave them in the comments! I’m just giving you brief overviews / topics. The details of such side-projects are what you all get paid for as Machine Learning Engineers! But if you want any advice on implementing them, I’d be happy to give you some more ideas!

If these ideas helped you think of any ideas of your own, feel free to share with the rest of us in the Comments section!

1. Make a simple sales-forecasting model using only regularized linear regression to predict the next 12 months of sales.
1. Take the sales-forecasting model above and measure it’s prediction accuracy.
1. Use a model from a friend and measure it’s performance/accuracy on a set of your own gathered data.
1. Get involved in the Kaggle community. Try out someone else’s notebook and see what other people are finding!
1. [Findings about Colleges and Enrollments by State](https://www.kaggle.com/devisangeetha/find-your-university-in-us-with-leaflet-viz)
