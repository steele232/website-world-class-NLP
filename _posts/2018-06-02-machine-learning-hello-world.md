Hey Guys! I wanted to share a quick Machine Learning resource with you! It’s a Hello World tutorial on Youtube from a Google Developer named Josh Gordon. [Here’s the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw) and I’ve embedded it below.

I’ve also included a FAQ for help.

I’ve included more Free Resources below that, recommended from the guy in the Video.

LASTLY: The Python Programming Language is used a lot in Machine Learning and Data Science, so I’d DEFINITELY recommend going through the process of setting up this environment yourself. It will pay off I promise. Machine Learning can get really heady with so many new concepts, so I’m trying to bring it down a little so we can see Machine Learning in practice by getting our hands dirty with this tutorial.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- How do I know which version of anaconda to download? (2.7 or 3.6?)
  - Find out which version of Python you have installed and install Anaconda with the same (or similar) version numbers. I had Python 3.6 installed, so I installed Anaconda for 3.6.
- How do I know which version I have, or if I even have Python installed?
  - Start your command line program (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac)
  - Type ‘python’ and hit enter.
  - If you have it installed, it should give you some sort of message and then a ‘>>>’ where you can type python commands. In the leading message, there is a version number. My Mac came installed with 2.7.14 I guess.
  - If you get an error message saying something like ‘command not known’ or ‘command not found’ or ‘you don’t have permission to use this file’ then you probably don’t have python installed.
- How do I install Python?
  - Installing Anaconda will do that for you.


## More Recommended Resources

Josh Gordon from this video recommended some other free resources. He gave this comment in response to someone else.

“My goal is just to help folks get started. There are many outstanding computer science courses I’d recommend if you’re curious to learn more!

- Try Stanford’s excellent CS231n: http://cs231n.github.io/
- We also have a Udacity course on Deep Learning https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning–ud730
- And, the gold standard of intro to machine learning is of course Andrew Ng’s course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
- There are great books too! http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ and http://www.deeplearningbook.org/“
