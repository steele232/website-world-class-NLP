Hey all! I just wanted to share [an article](https://hackernoon.com/we-already-know-blockchains-killer-apps-f2d443eba35) I just read. I don’t have much to add because I don’t know too much about Block chain (yet?). I’ve learned about some of the properties of block chain technologies before, but this article really helped me see the the value of the technologies.

His main focus is on the “Killer Apps” of Blockchain. Some people were waiting for the real value of blockchain technologies to show up, but he shares how and where blockchain technologies are most valuable right now.

I’m not sure what else to say… other than “GO READ THIS NOW” haha. [Here is the Link again](https://hackernoon.com/we-already-know-blockchains-killer-apps-f2d443eba35)

Have a great day!
