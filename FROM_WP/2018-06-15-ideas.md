# 10 Ideas for ML Side Projects (6/15/2018)

Hello Everyone!

If you haven’t caught on, ML stands for Machine Learning and it’s the topic of this entire blog!

So I’m about to give you 10 of my many ML side project ideas! If you have questions about them, feel free to leave them in the comments! I’m just giving you brief overviews / topics. The details of such side-projects are what you all get paid for as Machine Learning Engineers! But if you want any advice on implementing them, I’d be happy to give you some more ideas!

If these ideas helped you think of any ideas of your own, feel free to share with the rest of us in the Comments section!

1. Practise using Google Cloud Platform (or other Cloud platforms like Azure or AWS) to host and train models
1. Practise using Google Cloud Platform (or other platforms) to host containers
1. Try making a keyboard that learns new words that the User can input
1. Try making a Chatbot that can learn new words from the User
1. Try making a Telegram chatbot (https://www.process.st/telegram-bot/) (Hello World level is good at this point, but you could extend it later)
1. Try out the IBM Watson API with a limited free developer account (https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/)
1. Take the GCP Architecting Course and then show off something you’ve learned by deploying something to GCP (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-architecture)
1. Create a IBM chatbot of yourself like this person did! (https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/03/bot-yourself/)
1. Make an IBM chatbot of yourself / your grandparents. Input things that they like to repeat and then try and simulate talking to you them in some way. Then one day when you’re gone you can have a little taste of them still!
1. Try and make a chatbot of someone in your ancestry if you have a lot of records about them. You could use a clustering (unsupervised learning) algorithm to connect chat inputs to some of the events in their life or thoughts they had.
