# Introducing Andrew Ng

Hey guys! I just wanted to introduce Andrew Ng, the world-renowned AI / ML expert, to you guys!Here are some reasons why I think that he is a rare gem, and why I've based most of my Machine Learning learning on his content and vision.When I first wanted to start learning about Machine Learning, I went to Youtube to see if I could find some simple tutorials to get me started. What I found were some EXTREMELY paranoid and fear-based videos about Artificial Intelligence that left me feeling very very uneasy. However, they led me to seek more authoritative and reliable sources and this brought me a video from Andrew Ng. I would suggest watching it immediately so you can get a feel for who he is and what he's all about. If you only have a minute, I'd suggest watching the clip from 0:10-4:30 and then start at 12:50 and end at 16:40 or 23:40.

Hey guys! I just wanted to introduce Andrew Ng, the world-renowned AI / ML expert, to you guys!

Here are some reasons why I think that he is a rare gem, and why I’ve based most of my Machine Learning learning on his content and vision.

When I first wanted to start learning about Machine Learning, I went to Youtube to see if I could find some simple tutorials to get me started. What I found were some EXTREMELY paranoid and fear-based videos about Artificial Intelligence that left me feeling very very uneasy. However, they led me to seek more authoritative and reliable sources and this brought me a [video from Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKpuX_yzdYs). I would suggest watching it immediately so you can get a feel for who he is and what he’s all about. If you only have a minute, I’d suggest watching the clip from 0:10-4:30 and then start at 12:50 and end at 16:40 or 23:40.

You can tell from this video and some other things I’ll share about him that he has a BIG abundance mentality, he’s ALWAYS giving his very advanced AI knowledge away for free and he wants to make a real difference in Society, not just continue the trend of helping the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I’ll quote him directly on this; he says:

“I hope that human beings can build an AI-driven society, everyone can enjoy medical care, each child receives personalized education, everyone has cheap self-driving cars, and everyone has a meaningful job. AI-driven society can improve everyone’s quality of life. But no company can do this on its own. Just as every recently graduated computer science student knows how to use the cloud, future programmers must also know how to use AI. There are millions of ways to use deep learning to improve the quality of human life, so society needs people from all over the world to work together to build a great AI system. Whether you are a California aspiring software engineer, a Chinese research scientist, or an Indian machine learning engineer, I hope you can use deep learning to solve the world’s challenges.”

As I’ve said before, he is actively focused on giving his Machine Learning expertise away for FREE. Below are some links to his content. (Did I mention that it’s free??)

He started coursera.com and is kind of the father of Massive-Online-Open-Courses (MOOC’s) movement. The first course on the site was his [Original Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

In the last year, he has added 5 deep learning courses that feature new techniques that have only been developed in the last 5 years. [This link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) goes to a list of his Newer Courses (it has a list of the course names; you can look up the individual names in the main search bar to enroll in the classes for free).

He’s writing a book and releasing it for free as it gets written. This one is less about the nuts-and-bolts of the algorithms and things. This is about using the algorithms to make products or systems that utilize the technology well. It’s called [“Machine Learning Yearning”]. [Here](http://www.mlyearning.org/) is the Draft Copy Sign Up (In my email, I had to go to the spam box to find his first email, but the rest came through my inbox).

Until Next Time!!!
